== Disk Layout
An attempt to provide an overview of what I have learned about the layout of the Prince of Persia disk during my
investigations.

===Code Placement on Disk
At first I had a hard time figuring out where each Prince Of Persia module ended up on the final disk.  This also made
it a bit difficult for me to figure out what the RW18 read calls were reading into memory when they specified particular
tracks.  I then noticed interesting lines at the end of many modules such as this from MASTER.S:
{{{
 usr $a9,1,$a80,*-org
}}}

It turns out that this causes the Merlin assembler to execute a user routine that has been registered on the developer's
machine.  In the case of Prince of Persia, it calls into the RW18 code to place the resulting binary at the specified
location on the disk. The code for this RW18 resident code is found in 
[[https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/blob/master/04%20Support/MakeDisk/USR18.S#L16 | 04 Support/MakeDisk/USR18.S]]
and the following comment gives a pretty good idea of what the parameters mean:
{{{
* usr <BbundID>,<track>,<byte offset 0-$11FF>,<byte length>
}}}

The BbundID's refer to values for indicating the side of the disk:
{{{
POPside1 = $a9
POPside2 = $ad
POPside3 = $79
}}}

The allowed bytes offset range would indicate that there are 18 256-byte pages per track which agrees with the name of
the routines: RW18.

Here is a list of the USR clauses from the POP sources sorted by location:
{{{

===Data Placement on Disk
Where the game data files should be placed in the disk image isn't as clear to me by just looking at the contents of
the source code checked into the git repository.  Through a lot of work it is possible to find where each sector of data
from disk is loaded into memory and then try to determine what data file was loaded into this location by looking at
what code later references this location in memory.  I started with this approach but found it too time consuming and a
bit error prone.  In the end I took an existing 3.5" disk image and compared the bytes in the image to the game data
files found in the git repository.  The result of this comparison was a map showing where each game data file was
located on the released game disk.  It also helped me to see initialized portions of the disk which didn't match any of
the data files in the git repository.


===3.5" First 16 Blocks
The first 16 blocks on the disk are in typical ProDOS format.  Here is a summary of their contents:

|= Start Block |= End Block |= Content Description |
| 0 |  0 | Standard ProDOS bootloader |
| 1 |  1 | Unused bootloader blocks - Zero filled |
| 2 |  5 | Volume Directory |
| 6 |  6 | Volume Bitmap - Bit Per Block |
| 7 |  7 | Index Block for PRODOS SystemFile |
| 8 | 15 | Data Blocks for PRODOS SystemFile |


=== Volume Directory
I pulled the original Volume Directory from a 3.5" disk image on the Asimov website.  This is an overview of what I
found in the Volume Directory on that image:

* The volume label is 6 characters: "P.O.P."
* Creation date is 0xDB 0xB2 0x01 0x0F
** 1101 1011 1011 0010 0000 0001 0000 1111
** Year = 101 1001 = 0x59 = 89
* ProDos 1.0
* Access is 0xC3 = Reformat | Renamed | Write | Read
* Volume entry length is the expected 0x27 bytes in length.
* There are 13 entries per volume block as expected.
* There is 1 active file entry in the root directory.
* Volume bitmap starts in block 6.
* There are a total of 0x0640 = 1600 blocks on this 3.5" disk.
* First and only file entry:
** Is a sapling (2 - 256 blocks) and has 6 characters in the filename: "PRODOS"
** File type of 0xFF means it is a System ProDOS file.
** Index block for this sapling file is at block 8 or offset 0x1000.
** Uses up 9 blocks (including the index block so 8 blocks of actual data.)
** File is 0x001000 = 4k bytes in length
** Creation date is 0x76 0xB4 0x08 0x0B
*** Year = 101 1010 = 0x5A = 90
** Version is 0x8 of the OS which created this file.
** Minimum version is 0x0 as expected.
** Access is 0xE3 = Destroyed | Renamed | Archive | Read | Write
** Aux_Type = 0x00 0x00
** Modified date is 0x76 0xB4 0x3A 0x0F

The single **PRODOS** file on this disk contains the assembled 6502 code for 
[[https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/blob/master/02%20POP%20Disk%20Routines/RW1835/POPBOOT35.S | POPBOOT35.S]]
and the 
[[https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/blob/master/02%20POP%20Disk%20Routines/RW1835/RW1835.POP.S | RW1835.POP.S]].
The ProDOS bootloader will load the contents of this system file into memory starting at address **0x2000**.

On the original disk the sapling index block for this file was located at block 8 and pointed to blocks 7 and 9 - 15
for the 4k of file data.  I manually modified the root directory file entry for this file and switched the index block
to be located at block 7 instead and pointed it to contiguous blocks 8 - 15 for the 4k of file data.  This makes it
easier to place the POPBOOT35.S and RW1835.POP.S object files into the disk image.  The original image
wasn't in this convenient form since when the first block of the file was written, the OS would have assumed that
the file could fit in 1 block and would have been treated as a seedling file, therefore putting the data in block 7.
When the next block was added to the file, the file would have been converted to a sapling file which can be larger than
1 block.  A sapling file would require a index block which would be placed in the next free block, block 8.

My version of the first 16 blocks on this disk can be found in the PRODOS.VOLUME binary file.

The rest of the blocks on the 3.5" disk are mapped from RW18 locations on the 5.25" disk and will be documented in
the following sections.
