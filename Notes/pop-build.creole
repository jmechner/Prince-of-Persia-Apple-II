==Quick Start
These are the quick steps to download and build the Prince of Persia sources to create an Apple II disk image:
* Download the Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II compressed archive from 
  [[https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/archive/master.zip]]
* Decompress and extract the contents of this archive.
* Follow the steps appropriate for your platform to complete your first build:

===Windows
These steps will assume that you have extracted the Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II archive to c:\Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II.
If you extracted to a different directory then you will need to substitute the path you used into the steps below.

* Start "Command Prompt".  [[http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chdos.htm | This page]] contains instructions on how
  to launch the command prompt from various versions of Windows.  Subsequent steps will be performed from within this
  command prompt.
* {{{cd c:\Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II}}}
* {{{Build\win32\make clean all}}}

This will result in the creation of a c:\Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II\PrinceOfPersia_3.5.hdv disk image for 3.5" media.\\
It will also create c:\Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II\PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideA.nib and 
c:\Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II\PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideB.nib disk images for sides A and B of 5.25" media.

//Tested on: Windows 7, and Windows XP//

===Macintosh OS X
These steps will assume that you have extracted the Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II archive to /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II.
If you extracted to a different directory then you will need to substitute the path you used into the steps below.

* Start "Terminal".  This can be launched by pressing the {{{Command + Space}}} keys together to display the Spotlight 
  search control, typing "Terminal", and launching the top Spotlight search result.  Subsequent steps will be performed
  from within this terminal.
* {{{cd /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II}}}
* {{{Build/osx32/make clean all}}}

This will result in the creation of a /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/PrinceOfPersia_3.5.hdv disk image for 3.5" media.\\
It will also create /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideA.nib and 
/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideB.nib disk images for sides A and B of 5.25" media.

//Tested on: Lion, and Snow Leopard//

===Linux
These steps will assume that you have extracted the Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II archive to /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II.
If you extracted to a different directory then you will need to substitute the path you used into the steps below.

* Start a "Terminal" console window.  Subsequent steps will be performed from within this terminal.
* {{{cd /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II}}}
* {{{make clean all}}}

This will result in the creation of a /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/PrinceOfPersia_3.5.hdv disk image for 3.5" media.\\
It will also create /Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideA.nib and 
/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II/PrinceOfPersia_5.25_SideB.nib disk images for sides A and B of 5.25" media.

**Note:** This repository only includes 32-bit Intel tool binaries.  If you are running a 64-bit version of Intel Linux
          then you may need to install the 32-bit support libraries.  This problem typically shows up as a file not
          found error when you attempt to run tools such as snap and crackle.  On Ubuntu, the necessary libraries can
          be installed by running {{{sudo apt-get install ia32-libs}}}

//Tested on: Ubuntu 8.10, and Ubuntu 12.04//


==Important Notes!
There are some important things to note about the current state of this build system:
* The output disk image won't work on the Apple IIGS.  The Prince of Persia sources use 65802 instructions in some
  Apple  IIGS specific code paths.  This instruction set isn't supported in the current assembler.  This will be
  corrected in the near future.
* When playing from 5.25" disks, you will get the following message when it is necessary to switch sides of the disk,
  "Insert Prince of Persia Disk".  It should indicate the side of the disk it wants but I have left the code configured
  to build for 3.5" disks so it displays this message instead.  Turning 3.5" disk support off would turn on 5.25"
  copy protection and this would cause problems.
  

==Make Targets/Variables
The makefile currently used for building Prince of Persia supports the following targets:
* **clean -** Delete all build output and setup for clean build.
* **all -** Assembles all required source files and creates a disk image.

The makefile also responds to the following variables being set in the user's environment or when launching make:
* **VERBOSE -** Set this to a non-zero value to have each build step output the tool commands issued.
* **RELEASE_PATCH -** Set this to a non-zero value to apply patches to a few of the assembly language source files to
                      bring them uptodate with the final released disk.  This option only patches intermediate files
                      used as part of the build process and leaves the original source files intact.

For example, if you want to perform a clean build with the final release patches applied, you could run:
{{{
make clean all RELEASE_PATCH=1
}}}
